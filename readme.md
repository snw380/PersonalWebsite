<h1>Personal website</h1>

My site is built as a portfolio that will soon display my porjects, an about and a contact page. This site was also built with mobile capabilities in mind. The navigational bar starts with a little card icon, this will direct you to a navigational page with a brief description of each page. If you are in mobile then the nav bar will collapse and three lines will come up with the option to drop the menu down. Including that, the site utilizes; responsive images, rows, columns and media queries.

  <h2>Other Info</h2>
  Too help build this site was Bootsrap link, using its CSS and javascript files.
  In my own CSS I had used their class names and id's to over write some of the files to my liking. For instance, I changed the "hover" tag to black instead of blue to make sure the site had the some feel all the way around.
